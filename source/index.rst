USNAN SDK Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the USNAN SDK documentation. The USNAN SDK is a Python library that provides
tools for working with USNAN (United States Network for Advanced NMR) data. Specifically,
it provides dataclasses that map to data in the NAN archive, and provides an API client to
fetch them.

It currently supports fetching public data records, but a planned future update will add support
for authenticating to enable fetching and modifying data records according to the user's credentials.
