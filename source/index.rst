USNAN SDK Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the USNAN SDK documentation. The USNAN SDK is a Python library that provides
tools for working with USNAN (United States Network for Advanced NMR) data. Specifically,
it provides dataclasses that map to data in the NAN archive, and provides an API client to
fetch them.

This SDK enables developers to access USNAN data from within their applications with ease.

The SDK offers classes that correspond to the core data types in NAN, and provides easy
access to the data itself.
